Jenkins + Spock Examples
==============================

Here are some example projects that use Jenkins Pipeline code in different ways and show off how to write unit tests for that code using `jenkins-spock`.

These example repositories work as much as possible, but their Jenkins pipelines and "deploy application" logic are made-up and won't actually run or deploy anything to anywhere.

Integration Tests
-------------------------

Some of these example projects are generated from integration-test projects.
Check [src/test/resources/test-projects/](src/test/resources/test-projects/) to see which of the "example projects" came from an integration-test project.
